 * Utility class for thread synchronization.

 * <p>This class provides synchronized methods for threads to wait and notify each other.</p>
 *
 * <p>It includes flags to indicate the status of source and target operations, as well as a counter for completed loader threads.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ThreadSync sync = new ThreadSync();
 *
 * // In a thread
 * sync.ObserverWait();
 *
 * // In another thread
 * sync.ObserverNotify();
 * }
 * </pre>
